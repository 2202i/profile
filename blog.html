    <p>What is a Supercar?</p>
    <p>☰☰☰☰☰</p>
    <p>The term hypercar derives from a supercar, which is the top of the range in performance cars, with the most supreme technology, design, and performance. Back in 1920, the term supercar was first used in The Times newspaper to describe the 6.7 litre Bentley Ensign for their readers to know it was a top of the range specification automotive car.</p>

    <p>A hypercar can be defined as the most superior and high-performance cars on the market worldwide. Only 1% of cars are hypercars, the first one was produced in 1963, the Lamborghini Miura. This was also known as the P400. The Lamborghini Miura can accelerate to 60mph in under 6 seconds and on to a top speed of 180mph whereas one of the newest hypercars on the market can go from 0-186mph in under 9 seconds! This hypercar is the Lotus Evija electric hypercar (pronounced ih-via), the name means ‘the living one’. The Lotus Evija is highly exclusive as only 130 will ever be built. This puts the Lotus Evija at the top as the most powerful supercar to ever be built plus it is fully electric taking only 18 minutes on a 350-kilowatt charge. If you have a spare £2 million sat in your bank account then this Lotus Evija could be yours.</p>
